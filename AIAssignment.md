# Homework 5 AI Synthesis Activity

## Activity: You used AI

### Part 1

> Cite the usage by including screenshots, a text transcript, or a link to the conversation with your AI of choice. Make sure to include any context, instructions, and all the conversations you had with the AI.

For this homework, the only time I used AI was to generate a secure, random JWT token secret for my `.env` file.  

### Part 2

> Write about why you used AI. Was there a gap in knowledge you wanted to fill? Were the answers through traditional search engines not adequate? Did you want to let AI help you format something in a quick manner?

I used AI here because I wanted a strong random secret that wasn’t guessable, it saved me from manually thinking up a random string, and it didn’t affect any logic, structure, or problem-solving parts of the assignment. This felt appropriate because the JWT secret is purely configuration, not part of the coded solution.

### Part 3

> Evaluate the AI's response. If you asked multiple questions, you can pick one of the responses the AI generated. Does the AI answer your question properly? Does it hallucinate any details? Could there be room to improve this response through manual editing? Did you accept this response fully or adapt parts of it into your work?

It gave me a good response. It provided me with a not-easily-guessable token.

### Part 4

> If you used unfamiliar syntax or concepts generated by AI within your assignment, be sure to research them and explain what those concepts are to demonstrate your understanding.
